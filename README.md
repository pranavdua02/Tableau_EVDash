# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis ⚡🚗

Welcome to my Tableau project: Electric Vehicle Data Analysis! This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of electric vehicle (EV) data to provide insights into the growth and market position of various EV types. With the increasing adoption of EVs, it's crucial for companies to visualize their progress and compare their performance with competitors. My dashboard offers a comprehensive view, highlighting key trends and metrics in the EV market.

## Project Highlights 📈🌱

- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** are leading the charge, outstripping Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel (CAF)** eligible vehicles are making significant sales strides.

## Key Skills and Learning Outcomes 🧠💡

In this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply several key skills:

1. **Generating Insights from Raw Data**: Extracting meaningful information from raw datasets to understand market trends and patterns.
2. **Focusing on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Identifying and visualizing essential KPIs to track the performance and growth of different EV types.
3. **Selecting Appropriate Charts**: Choosing the right charts and graphs to represent data effectively and enhance comprehension.
4. **Designing a Dashboard with Tiled Containers**: Creating a well-structured dashboard using tiled containers to follow best design practices.
5. **Understanding Data Item Hierarchies**: Recognizing and utilizing data hierarchies to drill down and analyze data at different levels of granularity.
6. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Applying filters and parameters to manipulate data and uncover deeper insights.

## Dashboard Features 🖥️📊

- **Comprehensive View**: A detailed overview of the EV market, showcasing the performance of BEVs, PHEVs, and CAF eligible vehicles.
- **Interactive Filters**: Dynamic filters to explore data from various angles and gain different perspectives.
- **KPI Tracking**: Visual representation of key metrics to monitor market trends and performance.

## How to Use the Dashboard 🚀

1. **Explore Different Views**: Use the interactive filters to explore the data from different perspectives.
2. **Monitor KPIs**: Keep an eye on the KPIs to track the performance and growth of different EV types.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Use the charts and graphs to analyze market trends and gain insights into the EV market.

## Conclusion 🎯

This project has provided me with valuable experience in data analysis and visualization using Tableau. The insights gained from this analysis can help companies understand their position in the EV market and make informed decisions to drive growth and success.
